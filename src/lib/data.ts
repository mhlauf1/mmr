For each open role we assigned to Adam, he took the time to meet with the hiring manager to learn what their needs were for the open position. Adam worked diligently to always find us the best qualified candidates. One role which comes to mind was for an EHS Manager at one of my plants, which had been open for a year. Adam successfully found us an incredible candidate for this position, when other recruiters had failed. I also appreciated Adam providing us with regular and ongoing status updates for the roles assigned to him. I enthusiastically recommend Adam as an additional recruiting resource for your organization.",
